# Svelonia.Fluent

`Svelonia.Fluent` is a library that wraps Avalonia UI controls with a fluent, chainable API. It enables you to build your entire user interface in C#, providing a modern, declarative developer experience similar to SwiftUI or Flutter, but with the power of the .NET ecosystem.

## Why Fluent?

*   **Type Safety**: No more magic strings or runtime binding errors common in XAML.
*   **IntelliSense**: Discover available properties and methods directly in your IDE.
*   **Refactoring**: Rename symbols and move code with confidence using standard C# refactoring tools.
*   **Less Context Switching**: Keep your logic and UI definition in the same language.
