# Svelonia.Kit

`Svelonia.Kit` provides the high-level application structure for Svelonia apps, primarily focusing on routing and page navigation. It is designed to work seamlessly with the source generators in `Svelonia.Gen` to provide a "File-system based routing" experience.

## Components

1.  **[Routing](./Routing.md)**
    The router, navigation methods, parameters, and guards.

2.  **[Pages & Hosting](./Pages.md)**
    The `Page` base class and the `NavigationHost` control.
